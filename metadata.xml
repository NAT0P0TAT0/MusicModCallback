    <description>[h1]What is it?[/h1]
A complete rewrite of the music system, done purely so it can run callbacks before playing tracks.
[b]You should only download this mod if another mod requires it.[/b]
(Or if you want the built in revelations music fix)

[h1]What can I do now that I couldn't do before?[/h1]
- Stop custom music from resetting every room
- Specify different music tracks for any condition the lua api can detect
[b]- Use music mods in conjunction with StageAPI. No more music resetting every room in the catacombs.[/b]
- Prevent music from playing (this includes jingles, room specific music, whatever)

[h1]Known Bugs[/h1]
- Stage music doesn't continue after treasure room jingle

[h1]Compatability[/h1]
[b]This mod has built in compatability with:[/b]
StageAPI
Revelations Ch. 2

This mod is NOT compatible with any mod that contains a [b]modified resources/music.xml[/b] (unless listed above). Raw ogg replacements and music added via [b]content/music.xml[/b] is fine.
If you really need to use a resources/music.xml for layers or intros, see the Notes section of [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/1767191363/1638661595064736511/]the documentation.[/url]
